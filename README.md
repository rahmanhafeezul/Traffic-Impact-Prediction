Traffic-Impact-Prediction
=========================
The files contain the MATLAB code which could be used to predict the real time short term and long
term traffic conditions in the city of Los Angeles. The dataset is procured from LADOT( Los Angeles 
Department of Transportation).
The algorithm used is a slight modification of the Co-operative Contextual Bandit Strategy Algorithm 
which is based on the idea that the prediction accuracy is higher when the various sensors predicting
the traffic conditions share information amongst each other and predict for other sensors when demanded.
